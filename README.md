#### NOTE: 
1 Issue I faced here was that I needed instant notification from one device to multiple devices. Problem with using "Topics was time latency and the requirement was instant notification.Whereas using registration token had issues with lot of deprecated libraries and size limitations. Here, [One Signal](https://onesignal.com/) was a big relief.
